- refactor scene/logic

[-] call scripts in random order

- important play improvements
	[-] prevent players from leaving the field
	[-] prevent players from overlaping the possessing player
	[-] check if formation is valid
	- set 5 seconds limit for possession

- add logfile (for each script) and entries
	[-] if "setSpeed" fails => check for movement while possessing the disc, prevent it and write warning to respective logfile
	[-] if "shoot" fails
	[-] if "snatch" fails
	[-] on "print" (instead of output to console)
	[-] print time to logfile

[-] find better solution for choice of starting team (initial possession)
	[-] possibly shooting disc to any direction at the start

[-] improve game/match feeling
	- countdown before play starts/resumes
	[-] pause after score

[-] max/min speed for disc/players
	[-] add globals
	[-] add info for scripter if he tries to shoot/setSpeed to fast; clamp scripter input

- add optional metadata in script
	- team name, scripter name, version

- add possibility for zipped files (including multiple script files; one of which will be executed)

- implement time control for execution duration of the scripts

- implement game statistics
	- play statistics (possession, player positioning, passing accuracy, average pass length)
	- script statistics (execution duration)

- handle exceptions
	[-] scriptfile not found

- profiling and performance optimization
