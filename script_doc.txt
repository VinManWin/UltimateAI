types
	As lua is not typesafe the following 'types' are just lua tables with specified metatables,
	however they do provide different fields that are documented here.
	
	Vector2 (represents a 2D-vector)
		- has fields for arithmetic operations with two Vector2s (x, -) and with a Vector2 and a Number (*, /)
		- has a function 'length' that returns the length of the vector
		- has a function 'norm' that returns the unit vector

	Field (represents the field on which the match is played)
		- has fields that hold information about the geometry of the field
			(note that the center of the field is the geometrical origin)
		- width
		- height
		- zoneWidth
		- boundLvl (distance from the center to the left and right bounds)
		- boundExtent (distance from the center to the top and bottom bounds)
		- zoneLvl (distance from the center to the left and right zone)

	Disc (represents the disc)
		- position (Vector2 representing the position of the disc)
		- velocity (Vector2 representing the velocity (i.e. the speed and direction) of the disc)

	Team (represents a team)
		- players (an array of all the players in the team; the index is identical with the number of the respective player)
		- score (an integer representing the score that the team has achived in the match so far)

	Player (represents a player)
		- position (Vector2 representing the position of the player)
		- velocity (Vector2 representing the velocity (i.e. the speed and direction) of the player)
		- team (the team of which the player is a member)
		- number (the number of the player)
		- setVelocity(p, v) (function that sets the players 'p' velocity 'v')
		- shoot(p, v) (function that shoots the disc with the given velocity 'v'; will do nothing if the player 'p' is not in possession of the disc)
		- snatch(p) (function that snatches the disc; if the disc is within reach, the player 'p' will possess it after the call)

globals
	- field (the field; of type 'Field')
	- disc (the disc; of type 'Disc')
	- myTeam (your team; of type 'Team')
	- opponentTeam (your opponent's team; of type 'Team'

	- Vector2.new() (returns a new Vector2)
	- Player.maxSpeed (number representing the maximum speed each player can attain)
	- Player.radius (number representing the radius of each player)
	- Disc.minSpeed (number representing the minimum speed the disc can attain)
	- Disc.maxSpeed (number representing the maximum speed the disc can attain)
	- Disc.radius (number representing the radius of the disc)
	- print(...) (writs the given values to the logfile)

event handler
	getFormation(starting)
		- is called before the match starts and before it restarts after one team scores.
		- is provided a boolean 'starting' that is true if your team will be possessing the ball (i.e. the opponent just scored).
		- is expected to return an array with seven elements of type 'Vector2' representing the initial positions of your players.

	start()
		- is called after the match starts/restarts

	update(seconds)
		- is called repeatedly while the match is running
		- is provided a number 'seconds' representing the time that has passed since the last call of 'update'

	onDiscWithinReach(player)
		- is called when one of your players is close enough to the disc to snatch it
		- is provided mentioned player

	onOpponentShot()
		- is called after your opponent shot the disc

	onOpponentSnatch(score)
		- is called after your opponent snatched the disc
		- is provided a boolean 'score' stating whether your opponent scored with that snatch

	onBounce()
		- is called after the disc bounced of the bounds
